Description: LiverToxQSAR is an R package designed for the prediction of liver
  toxicity in chemical compounds using quantitative structure-activity 
  relationship (QSAR) models. The package combines chemical structure 
  data with advanced machine learning techniques to assess the hepatotoxic
  potential of compounds. It is particularly useful for researchers in drug
  development and toxicology, providing an efficient tool for early-stage
  toxicity screening and risk assessment. LiverToxQSAR facilitates data-driven
  decision-making by enabling users to evaluate potential liver toxicity based
  on chemical structure and molecular properties.
